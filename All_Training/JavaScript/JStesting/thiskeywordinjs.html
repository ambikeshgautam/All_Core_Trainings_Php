        //         What is this?

        // The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

        // It has different values depending on where it is used:

        //     In a method, this refers to the owner object.
        //     Alone, this refers to the global object.
        //     In a function, this refers to the global object.
        //     In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
        //     In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
        //         //     Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.
        //         this in a Method

        // In an object method, this refers to the "owner" of the method.

        // In the example on the top of this page, this refers to the person object.

        //         // The person object is the owner of the fullName method.
        //         this in a Function (Default)

        // In a JavaScript function, the owner of the function is the default binding for this.

        // So, in a function, this refers to the Global object [object Window]
        // Create an object:
        var person = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            id: 5566,
            fullName: function() {
                return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
            }
        };

        // Display data from the object:
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.fullName();
    </script>
